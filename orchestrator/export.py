# What a core dump is called, as a filename glob, and the reason this bundle
# knows the word at all: the crash-capture path copies
# `find -name 'core*' -type f` out of the engine's data volume into
# `<run_dir>/cores/<engine>-<dataset>-<phase>-<pass>/`, keeping each file's own
# name. So the set of core files that can be sitting in a run directory is
# exactly the set this glob describes, and nothing else here has to guess.
#
# **MUST STAY IN STEP WITH `ops_pass.CORE_FILE_GLOB`**, which is the constant
# that capture matches on. Duplicated rather than imported, deliberately and
# for two reasons. The first is timing: the capture half is not on `master`
# yet, and a branch that imports a constant which does not exist is red until
# the other one merges, for no benefit. The second outlives the first --
# `export.py` is a leaf that imports the standard library and nothing else,
# which is what lets `webui/server.py` import it inside a request handler;
# `ops_pass` drags in `docker_ctl`, `engines`, `config` and `manifest`, none of
# which a web request that tars a directory has any use for. Collapsing the
# duplication therefore means moving the string somewhere both halves can read
# without `export` acquiring that dependency -- not importing `ops_pass` here.

    Deduplicated rather than counted: one corpus appears once per

    **First-seen order, deliberately, and pinned by a test.** This diverges
    from `report/scope.py::_ordered`, which sorts: its axes are compared
    against each other and against fixtures, where sorting is what makes two
    reads equal, and this is prose for a human reading one line. Run order
    tells that reader which corpus the run got to before it stopped, which
    alphabetical order destroys. Changing `return out` to `return
    sorted(out)` is a one-word mutant that passed the whole suite until
    `test_the_log_order_is_the_run_order_and_not_the_alphabet` existed, and
    it would have taken `full-20261015-215006`'s README line off

    fashion, glove, sift, gist, which is not sorted. That byte-identical
    result on all 12 archived bundles is the measurement this whole term
    order was justified by, so the property it rests on gets a test.

    hand-edited manifest with a non-string corpus name would otherwise reach
    `", ".join(...)` and raise, and `readme_text` is called from the export

) -> Callable[[tarfile.TarInfo], Optional[tarfile.TarInfo]]:
    """A `tarfile.add(filter=...)` callable that leaves core dumps out.

    Returning `None` for a member is how `filter` drops one, and `add` applies
    the filter to every member it walks, so this sees a core at any depth. It
    needs to: a core reaches a run directory in two shapes, the captured
    `cores/<engine>-<dataset>-<phase>-<pass>/core.<pid>` and -- for any process
    whose working directory is the mounted run directory itself -- a bare
    `core.<pid>` in the root of it.

    Each dropped member is appended to `dropped` as (path relative to the run
    directory, size in bytes), which is what the README then discloses. A
    mutable accumulator because `filter` has nowhere else to put it; the caller
    freezes the list before passing it on.

    WHAT IT WOULD DROP THAT IS NOT A CORE, said here rather than discovered
    later: any regular file whose basename matches the glob, so `cores.jsonl`
    or `core-notes.txt` would go too. Nothing writes such a name. The twelve
    archived run directories under `ALL_RESULTS/results/` hold
    `checkpoints.json`, `run-manifest.json`, `mem-*.jsonl`, `ops-*.jsonl`,
    `logs/*.log`, `.cache/*.npy` and `report/`, plus `vb-label.json` from a web
    UI import, and not one entry in any of them begins with those four
    letters. Narrowing the predicate below the capture side's own glob would be
    the worse failure anyway: it would keep a file that half had collected
    precisely because it is a core.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT DROP IS A DIRECTORY, whatever the directory is called.
    Two consequences, both wanted. `filter` returning `None` for a directory
    makes `add` skip the entire subtree without ever walking into it, so
    excluding `cores/` as a unit would be cheaper and would leave nothing to
    name or size in the README -- and the disclosure is the half of this that
    matters. And a directory named `core-something` keeps its contents, each
    file judged on its own basename. The emptied `cores/<quad>/` directory
    travels in the bundle, which is a second signal to the recipient that
    something was taken out of it.

    Matched case-sensitively because `find -name` on the capture side is, and
    because the kernel writes the name in lower case: on a case-insensitive
    filesystem `fnmatch.fnmatch` would additionally drop a `CORE.DAT` that
    capture had never looked at.

    A SYMLINK OR HARD LINK whose own name matches is also not a regular file
    and is also kept, and the two differ. A symlink costs nothing -- tar
    stores the target string, not the bytes. A hard link would be stored as a
    link to the member its inode was first seen under, and `tarfile` registers
    that inode in `gettarinfo`, BEFORE the filter runs, so the member it names
    may be one this filter has just dropped and extracting it would fail. That
    is recorded rather than handled: nothing here makes either one -- capture
    is `cp -p`, which writes a new file -- and the failure is loud at
    extraction rather than a silent omission, which is the direction this
    repository prefers to fail in.

WHAT THIS IS
  A benchmark of built-in vector search across relational databases, all using
  an HNSW index, so the comparison is of implementations rather than of
  algorithms.

TO READ IT
  Open report/report.html in any browser. It is self-contained: the charts are
  inlined and nothing is fetched from the network, so it works offline and
  looks the same everywhere.

  Read its Validity section before the charts. It lists measurements that did
  not use the vector index, filtered queries that returned short, and anything
  about the environment that narrows what the numbers mean.

THE NUMBERS ARE SCOPED TO THIS MACHINE
  host            {host.get('hostname', 'unknown')}
  CPU             {cpu.get('model', 'unknown')}
  cores           {cpu.get('physical_cores', '?')} physical / {cpu.get('logical_cpus', '?')} logical{' (hybrid)' if cpu.get('hybrid') else ''}

  kernel          {host.get('kernel', 'unknown')}

  MariaDB MHNSW and AliSQL VIDX both document AVX-512 distance kernels. Results
  from a host without it do not transfer to one with it.

  Viewing works. REGENERATING the report on your machine does not produce the
  same thing: the recall measurements live in results/annb/, a sibling of this
  directory rather than part of it, and scoring them needs the dataset file.
  Neither is in here. Without them a regenerated report loses its recall
