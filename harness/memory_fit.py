"""Will an engine's index build fit in the server's memory limit?

One function, used in three places so they cannot disagree: the orchestrator
refuses a unit up front with it (`orchestrator/cli.py:_memory_refusal`), the
report states the refusal from the figures it returns, and
`docs/04-engine-notes.md`'s MyVector memory table is checked against it by
`tests/test_e25_myvector_memory_fit.py`.

Pure arithmetic, no numpy: it runs on the host, where the orchestrator lives
and the framework's host requirements are python3 and pyyaml only.

Only MyVector has a model here (`capabilities.memory_fit: myvector` in its
engine config). Its HNSW graph is hnswlib memory in mysqld's heap -- resident,
unpageable, outside `innodb_buffer_pool_size` -- and its build additionally
holds the whole (id, vector) result set client-side while it inserts
(`BuildMyVectorIndexSQL`: `mysql_store_result`). A graph that does not fit is
not a slow run, as it would be for MariaDB's or AliSQL's graph cache; the
container's OOM killer ends it mid-build.
