"""One benchmark client, as an OS process, and what crosses the fork.

Split out of `harness/workloads/clients.py`, which owns the pool, the window
and the measurement policy. The reason is this repository's 800-line ceiling
and the reason the ceiling exists: `clients.py` stood at 791 lines before G3,
so there was no substantive change to it that would have fitted. The same
argument produced `metrics/latency.py` and `churn_readers.py`. **It produced
`transfer_deadline.py` too, and the cut was forced the same way**: this file
reached 799 lines of 800 and the next change to it was a three-line
correctness fix that did not fit, so the span-transfer deadline -- the
watchdog, its two flags and the accessor `ClientPool.stop` reads -- went
there. `TransferDeadline` is mixed into `Client` precisely so none of the
patch targets moved; that module's docstring has the argument.

**WHAT THE SPLIT HAD TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT, because this repository has been
caught by it twice.** A module that re-exports a name does not SHARE it:
rebinding `clients.SERVED_CONCURRENCY_FLOOR` does not reach
`latency.scaling_status`, and `tests/test_g1_client_concurrency.py` asserts
that asymmetry so a mutation aimed at the wrong module is not taken for a
clean result. Five existing tests patch a name ON `clients` and expect it to
reach the pool:

* `clients.window_concurrency` and `Instruments.merge` are read by
  `ClientPool.stop`, which stayed in `clients.py`. Unaffected.
* `clients.BARRIER_TIMEOUT_S`, `clients.CLIENT_BARRIER_TIMEOUT_S` and
  `clients.JOIN_TIMEOUT_S` are the pool's protocol and stayed there too --
  but `Client` needs all three. It does **not** import them, because an
  imported copy would freeze at import and a patch on `clients` would reach
  nothing. `ClientPool.__init__` reads them out of its own module globals and
  hands them over as a `Timeouts` bundle, so `monkeypatch.setattr(cl,
  "CLIENT_BARRIER_TIMEOUT_S", 0.3)` before a pool is built still reaches the
  client that waits on it -- which is what `tests/test_t4b_readers.py` does.
* `clients.Client.launch` and `clients.Client._tell` are patched as class
  attributes, which reaches the one class object however it is imported.

So the only name whose patch target moved is `CLIENT_START_METHOD`, which
nothing patches, and the only behaviour change is that the three timeouts are
captured when a pool is CONSTRUCTED rather than when each client reads them.
Every existing patch site already sets them before construction.

**THE CLIENTS ARE PROCESSES, AND THE RUN THAT SETTLED IT.** The paragraph
this one replaces said running the clients as processes was "the fix for the
underlying limit" and "deliberately NOT attempted", and named the next real
run as the thing that would settle whether the limit was the client library.
That run finished on 2026-10-14 -- a six-engine `smoke` pass on a Xeon Gold
6230, `SMOKE/results/smoke-20261014-075119/` -- and it settled it in the
direction the paragraph feared. `served = qps x p50` (Little's law, the
quantity `served_concurrency` computes) per client, at 1 client -> 4 clients:

    mariadb      0.95 -> 0.238      pgvector   0.98 -> 0.974
    mariadb123   0.95 -> 0.237      valkey     0.97 -> 0.969
    alisql       0.97 -> 0.242      mongodb    0.99 -> 0.984

Exactly the three engines that share MariaDB Connector/Python are pinned near
one query in service however many clients ask; the three that do not are at
the client count. That is the per-library split the paragraph predicted,
measured on live engines, and it is not a property of this pool: the same
pool put pgvector at 2,466.9 -> 8,754.7 q/s over the same four-fold rise. The
same run's churn writer managed **11.991 rows/s** against four readers --
`extra.reinsert_rows_per_s`, 2,000 rows in 166.794 s -- where the SAME run's
single-threaded load of the SAME corpus recorded `ingest_rows_per_s` 769.9 at
`ingest_threads` 1. A factor of 64, inside one run, with nothing changed but
whether four readers were querying. That comparison is stronger than §7's
against a modelled ~150 rows/s, which is a 1.18M-row glove figure from
`orchestrator/estimate.py` and not this corpus.

So the clients are now OS PROCESSES and there is no shared interpreter lock in
the measurement path. What that costs, and what it did not cost, each measured
rather than accepted (the §7 list this answers is in `docs/05-methodology.md`):

* **fork, not spawn, and it is not a preference.** `driver_factory` is a
  callable the caller supplies, and every real one is unpicklable:
  `harness/main.py:309` is a `def` nested inside `main()`, whose
  `__qualname__` is `main.<locals>.driver_factory`, and pickle resolves a
  function by qualified name -- measured, `AttributeError: Can't pickle local
  object`. The test suite's factories are a `lambda` and a bound
  `FakeDriver.clone`, which fail the same way. Under spawn the pool would
  therefore have to be handed something picklable, which is a change to every
  caller's contract; under fork nothing is pickled at all, because the child
  IS the parent's address space. `CLIENT_START_METHOD` pins it rather than
  inheriting the interpreter default, which is `fork` on Linux today and
  becomes `forkserver` in 3.14.
* **Memory: the cost §7 states is NOT REAL, and the DIRECTION is a
  measurement.** §7 says "each client becomes an OS process with its own copy
  of the query set, so the harness container's memory grows with the client
  count". Under fork it does not: the query set is read-only in a client,
  `shard_queries` hands it out as a strided VIEW rather than a copy, and
  copy-on-write never copies a page nobody writes. Which is not the same as
  a child leaving the pages alone -- a shard is strided across the whole
  array, so every child READS pages spread over the entire query set and
  only the write is absent. §7 carries the figures and their label: SUPPLIED,
  and a sum over eight children against one 104.9 MB array rather than a
  per-client one. They are not restated here, because two copies of a number
  is how the last set drifted.
* **The clock the processes agree on is still `time.perf_counter()`, and this
  was verified rather than assumed.** It is `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)`
  on this platform, which is system-wide rather than per-process, so the
  reference point is shared across a fork -- unlike `time.process_time`.
  Measured over 200 forks, the child's `perf_counter - CLOCK_MONOTONIC`
  offset matches the parent's to a few microseconds and its reading fell
  inside the parent's bracketing pair 200 times out of 200; §7 has the
  readings. `tests/test_g3_process_clients.py` runs both probes at that same
  200 forks and asserts **10 ms, not those microseconds**: the quantity is a
  difference of two offsets each taken across two consecutive clock reads,
  so a descheduled thread widens it for a reason that is not the clock, and
  10 ms still separates the two clocks by four orders of magnitude --
  `time.process_time` is the control and a child reads near zero.
* **Client CPU accounting keeps working, for a structural reason.** `fork`
  never changes cgroup membership -- only an explicit write to
  `cgroup.procs` does -- so every client process is in the harness
  container's cgroup and `read_own_cpu_usec` still counts all of them.
  Verified by reading `/proc/self/cgroup` in parent and children and
  comparing the strings, which is exact; the MAGNITUDE cannot be checked on
  a developer box for the reason §2.3 gives, that outside a container the
  same file is the root cgroup and reads the whole machine.
* **`/dev/shm` needs no raising, measured.** `multiprocessing` semaphores
  are POSIX semaphores, one page each, and are unlinked immediately after
  `sem_open`, so they never appear in a directory listing -- measure the
  tmpfs, not the listing. One pool's whole footprint is **40,960 bytes** and
  is independent of the client count, because the go and halt flags are two
  Events for the pool rather than two per client (that design measured
  1,310,720 bytes at 32 clients). Pipes cost zero. The harness container is
  started with `shm_size` from the resource pass -- 2g normalized, 8g tuned,
  `orchestrator/ops_pass.py:138` -- so 40 KiB is five orders of magnitude
  inside it and nothing outside this module has to change.

**What did NOT survive, and a reader has to be told.** The clients no longer
share an interpreter, so a SYNTHETIC driver that models the defect by holding
the GIL -- `tests/test_g1_client_concurrency.py`'s `holding` family, a
pure-Python spin -- no longer serializes this pool and no longer produces
`concurrency_not_achieved`. The instrument is unchanged and still fires on a
pool that really serves one query at a time; what changed is that Python's own
lock can no longer put it there. The quantity is kept and the guard is kept,
because the SERVER serializing is the other cause `scaling_status` names and
this change does nothing about that one.

This also changes what every published multi-client number means, so it
invalidates comparison with every run measured before it, including the
2026-10-14 smoke run above -- `OPS_MEASUREMENT_VERSION` 6, bumped in the same
commit by the rule version 3's query-pool change earned one.

`ClientPool`, `PoolWindow`, `PoolSpec`, `Instruments`, the client-CPU
accounting and the sharding all stay in `clients.py`: they are the pool's, and
a client is a participant in the protocol rather than its owner.

class PoolError(RuntimeError):
    """A client failed. Raised rather than returned, and never swallowed.

    PR 4 §4.4 asks that a reader exception fail the record instead of hanging,
    and the hang is the specific hazard: a client that dies before the barrier
    leaves every other party waiting on it. `Client.attend` releases the
    barrier in a `finally` for that reason, `ClientPool.start` aborts the
    barrier on `BrokenBarrierError`, and `ClientPool.stop` joins with a
    timeout and then raises this. A pool that measured nothing raises too: a
    QPS of 0 from a pool whose clients all died reads as "the engine was
    slow", which is the one thing it is not evidence of.

    **AGAINST PROCESS DEATH RATHER THAN THREAD EXCEPTIONS, which is a wider
    set of failures and needed re-establishing.** A thread could only stop by
    raising, and the raise was an object in the same memory as the pool. A
    client process can also be killed outright -- `SIGKILL` from the OOM
    killer is the realistic one in a container with a memory limit, and it
    runs no handler, unwinds nothing and writes no error anywhere. The three
    ways that is caught, each with its own test in
    `tests/test_g3_process_clients.py`:

    * **Before the barrier.** The client's end of its pipe closes when it
      dies, so the parent's `recv` raises `EOFError` instead of blocking
      forever. `Client.attend` turns that into a `ClientDied` and ABORTS the
      barrier rather than joining it, so `start` raises at once instead of
      after the caller's whole window length. A thread could not reach this
      state at all.
    * **Mid-window.** The same `EOFError`, on the payload `stop` waits for,
      becomes the client's `error` and the existing failure path raises.
    * **After reporting.** A client that sent its spans and was then killed
      leaves `error` None and a window that looks complete, so `stop` checks
      `exitcode` as well: anything that is neither 0 nor None is a failure,
      and a negative one is the signal that killed it. Without this check a
      pool whose clients were OOM-killed at the end of a window would publish
      the partial window as a measurement.

    None of these is `qps == 0`. A window in which nothing finished is a
    legitimate measurement of a configuration whose queries outlast
    `ops.concurrency_duration_s`, and `concurrency._warn_nothing_finished`
    reports it on stderr; it must not be confused with a pool that died, and
    the two are distinguished by whether any client failed rather than by the
    throughput.

        -- a 30 s window of a fast engine is tens of megabytes of spans -- so
        joining first would deadlock the pool at exactly the configurations
        that matter most.

        started sending and then stalled while STILL ALIVE blocked the parent
        inside `recv` for as long as it lived, taking `stop` past
        `JOIN_TIMEOUT_S` without limit on the one call an operator cannot
        interrupt. One that DIES mid-send always raised. `_recv_by` closes it.

        the unbounded wait would have published late. Measured: a

        against `TRANSFER_GRACE_S`'s 1.0 s floor, 61% of it, where a
        realistic ~100,000-span one takes **0.057 s** and leaves ~17x margin.
        Remote rather than absent, and the right way round -- a `stop` that
        never returns is not a result either.
