"""Find out why Valkey will not take a write into a populated index.

The tuned churn has now failed the same way five times: a pipeline of a
thousand HSETs into the populated index does not come back, while a single
HSET into that same index, on a connection opened at the moment of the stall,
returns in one millisecond. The index is ready, the mutation queue is empty,
memory is 6 GB against a 101 GB cap, and the server sits at exactly the idle
CPU it had before the corpus was loaded.

Every explanation offered for that was reasoned from the outside and five were
wrong. This runs the experiment instead, and it is small enough to run while
something else is going on:

  1. write a batch into the populated index, having deleted nothing
  2. delete a batch, then write one
  3. halve the batch until a write returns

(1) against (2) says whether the delete is involved at all -- which is the
open question, and the one the benchmark cannot answer because it always
deletes first. (3) says whether it is about size, and where.

    ./run-benchmark.sh lab --engine valkey verify-valkey-churn.py --rows 100000

Start at a tenth of the corpus. The failure is index-size dependent -- it does
not happen at 20,000 rows and does at 990,000 -- so if a tenth comes back
clean, say so and raise it rather than concluding the path is healthy.

Add --full to run a whole churn cycle at the end and report the rate.
