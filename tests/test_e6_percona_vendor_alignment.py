"""What the Percona image takes from the vendor's own build, and what it must not.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
2026-10-14. After five configure failures and three failed compiles, the
natural proposal was made: stop hand-deriving cmake flags and just use
`build-ps/build-binary.sh`, the vendor's own build script, since it
demonstrably works. It was audited against the pinned tree rather than
dismissed, and the audit is written up as note 5 in
`docker/percona/Dockerfile`. The conclusion was that the script cannot be
used, for reasons that are about the measurement rather than convenience:

  * it names no `-march` on x86_64 -- its own flags come from `rpm --eval
    %optflags` behind `if [ -n "$(command -v rpm)" ]`, and this image is
    noble, so nothing in the script supplies one while four other
    source-built engines carry `x86-64-v3`. That is the first invariant in
    CLAUDE.md. (It does not ERASE a caller's, which an earlier version of
    this paragraph and of the Dockerfile's note 5 both got wrong:
    `build-binary.sh:233` is `export CFLAGS="$COMMON_FLAGS ${CFLAGS:-}"`, an
    append, so an exported `-march` survives it. Supplying the flag would
    still be our job, which is the point that stands.)
  * it enables PGO (a three-pass build) and LTO, so Percona would be the only
    engine in the study carrying either.
  * it enables Percona telemetry, which is periodic background work inside a
    server whose CPU and wall time this benchmark charges to query execution.
  * it needs the rocksdb submodule and a prebuilt V8 tree, and forces an
    in-source build.

Two of its flags are dead on this tree as well: `extra/libevent` and
`plugin/innodb_memcached` are both absent at this commit, and cmake warns
about unused `-D` variables rather than failing, so copying them would be
silent noise.

None of that is self-enforcing. The next person to hit a failed Percona
compile will reach for the same script, and the cost of the mistake is not a
broken build -- it is a build that SUCCEEDS and silently publishes a Percona
number produced with LTO, PGO and no `-march`, against six engines without
them. That failure has no symptom. This file is the symptom.

The flags this image DOES take from the vendor are asserted here too, because
a guard that only forbids is satisfied by taking nothing.
