"""The Percona builder's `make` invocation and the flag that makes it readable.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
2026-10-14. The first `./run-benchmark.sh build --engines percona` ever run
reached 20% and then 26% of the compile and ended, both times, with this as
its final line and nothing attributable above it:

    make: *** [Makefile:166: all] Error 2

`Makefile:166` is CMake's generated top-level `all`, whose whole recipe is
`$(MAKE) -f CMakeFiles/Makefile2 all`, so that line says only "something
below me failed". The compiler diagnostic and the `[ 26%] Building CXX
object ...` line naming the file it came from are written by two different
processes, and at `-j$(nproc)` -- 80 on the reference host -- they land far
apart in the log, as does the sub-make's own `make[1]: *** Error 1`.

The fix is `make --output-sync=target`, which has GNU Make capture each
target's two streams and emit them as one block. Measured on GNU Make 4.3
with a two-level recursive build at -j4 and one failing target:

    without the flag     the `error:` text is 3 unrelated progress lines
                         below the target that produced it, with 3 more
                         after it before the top-level error
    --output-sync=target the `error:` text is the NEXT line

This file guards three things that are easy to get wrong in that one-line
edit, each of which was a live hazard when it was made:

  1. the flag is `=target`. `=recurse` groups per recursive make, and the
     generated top-level Makefile recurses once for the entire build, so
     `=recurse` buffers every line until the build ends -- hours of silence.
     `=line` keeps progress live but still splits a multi-line diagnostic
     from the target that names the file.
  2. the flag sits AFTER `-j"$JOBS"`. `make -j` is the literal string
     tests/test_e1_percona_design.py and tests/test_e4_percona_build_flags.py
     split this Dockerfile on to bound the cmake flag region. Anything
     inserted between `make` and `-j` moves that boundary and drags the
     whole flag list across it, turning both of those suites vacuous rather
     than failing them.
  3. the Dockerfile's own account of the above is checked against the
     Dockerfile, because three claims in this file's comments have already
     reached master false (PR #22, corrected in PR #24).
