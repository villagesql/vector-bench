"""E22 -- the bundle meant to be emailed would carry a multi-gigabyte core.

THE DEFECT
----------
`orchestrator/export.py::write_bundle` collected a run directory with one
unfiltered call -- `archive.add(run_dir, arcname=run_id)` -- and `tarfile.add`
recurses by default and applies no filter, so every byte under the run
directory went into the bundle.

That was harmless only for as long as nothing large was written there. Crash
capture changes that: on a failed phase the server's core dump is copied into
`<run_dir>/cores/<engine>-<dataset>-<phase>-<pass>/`, under the capture side's
own `core*` glob, and a core is a full memory image of the server process. The
measured peak RSS for the `percona` engine in this project's archives is
**54.7 GiB** (gist-960, tuned, ann pass; the ops-phase peak is 48.5 GiB). Gzip
shrinks that and does not make it emailable, and `write_bundle` would have sat
there compressing it saying nothing about what it was doing.

The second half is the one that matters more, and it is why these tests weigh
the README as heavily as the member list. A recipient holds the bundle and has
no way to compare it against the run directory it was made from. An exclusion
they are not told about leaves them with a credible-looking copy of a run that
is quietly missing something -- which is the failure this repository is built
to avoid, rather than the crash it would be if the tar simply broke.

WHAT THESE TESTS PIN
--------------------
* A core goes, whether it is in the run root or nested -- the filter is applied
  to every member `add` walks, which is the reason it is a `filter=` callable
  and not a pre-walk.
* The directories around it stay. Dropping `cores/` as a directory would be
  cheaper, and `add` would then never walk into it, so there would be nothing
  left to name or size in the README. It also keeps a directory called
  `core-something` from taking its contents with it.
* Everything else in a run directory still travels, asserted as set equality
  against a fixture shaped like the twelve archived runs under
  `ALL_RESULTS/results/` -- which catches a predicate that grew as well as one
  that shrank.
* The README names each exclusion and its size, relative to the run directory,
  and says where the core still is and what to ask for instead.
* A run with no core produces the README it always produced, byte for byte.
* `detail` on success stays a bare path, because `cli.cmd_export` calls
  `os.path.getsize` on it. See `TestTheDetailIsStillAPath`.
