"""Why the Percona builder names a _FORTIFY_SOURCE level of its own.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
2026-10-15. Three builds of the Percona image died with
`make: *** [Makefile:166: all] Error 2` and nothing in the tail naming a
file. The serial retry added in the previous commit put the real error last:

    extra/libfido2/libfido2-1.15.0/src/.../aes256.c.o
    <command-line>: error: "_FORTIFY_SOURCE" redefined
    <command-line>: note: this is the location of the previous definition

Two definitions with different values were reaching the preprocessor. The
tree asks for 2 (`CMakeLists.txt:1586` at the pin prepends
`-DNDEBUG -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` for the non-debug build types), and the 3 came
from `dpkg-buildflags --get CPPFLAGS` by way of
`cmake/compile_flags.cmake:130`'s `ADD_LINUX_DEB_FLAGS()` -- a function that
also OVERWRITES CMAKE_C_FLAGS, discarding every flag the builder exported.
`tests/test_e8_package_flags_overwrite.py` owns that chain and the two cmake
flags that close it; the corrected account is in docker/percona/Dockerfile
above its cmake line.

That matters for how this file should be read. WHEN THIS FILE WAS WRITTEN THE
EMITTING SITE HAD NOT BEEN FOUND and the mechanism recorded here was the wrong
one: it supposed the tree's own 2 arrived as a `-Wp,-D...` the gcc driver's
scan could not see, so that the driver added its own default 3 beside it. No
such `-Wp,` define exists in this tree and the driver's default is not
involved -- both defines were ordinary `-D`s and the disagreeing one was
dpkg's. The flag this file guards therefore did NOT fix the build on its own,
because the export carrying it was thrown away too.

WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR
---------------------
The flag has an exact value and is not free to drift, but what it buys is much
narrower than this file first claimed, and the difference is worth stating
precisely.

What it buys is AGREEMENT. The level it names has to match the level the tree
prepends for its non-debug build types. A reader "modernising" 2 to 3 would
recreate the redefinition against the tree's 2; a reader dropping the value
entirely would get 1, which conflicts the same way.

What it does NOT buy is the level the project compiles at. With
`-DWITH_PACKAGE_FLAGS=OFF` now on the cmake line, deleting this token would
leave the tree's own `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` at `CMakeLists.txt:1586` stating the
level for every object in the cmake project; only sub-builds that read
`$CFLAGS` out of the ENVIRONMENT rather than from cmake would fall back to a
toolchain or distro default. So the token is belt-and-braces plus coverage of
those sub-builds -- not the thing that decides the project's hardening level.

AND THIS IMAGE WAS NOT COMPILING AT 3. An earlier version of this paragraph
said it was, and built an engine-to-engine codegen argument on top of that;
both are removed rather than softened. Pre-fix the compile line ended with the
tree's `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` from `CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO`, AFTER dpkg's
`=3` in `CMAKE_C_FLAGS`, and the last `-D` of a macro wins -- measured:
`gcc -O2 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -dM -E -` prints
`#define _FORTIFY_SOURCE 2`, and the reverse order prints 3. The effective
level was 2, which AGREES with both MariaDB pins
(`mariadb-11.8.8:CMakeLists.txt:290`, `mariadb-12.3.2:CMakeLists.txt:303`,
read at both pins), while a redefinition warning was printed in every
translation unit and the build died in libfido2. The real engine-to-engine
divergence was `-march`, and
`tests/test_e8_package_flags_overwrite.py` is where that argument lives.

# skips rather than failing a correctly set up machine.

# READ IT FOR WHAT IT IS: it establishes that the explicit level in CFLAGS
# suppresses the driver's own default, using UNSEEN_DEFINE_PROBE to make that
# default observable. It does NOT reproduce the build failure -- that needed
# dpkg-buildflags' `=3`, and tests/test_e8_package_flags_overwrite.py is where
