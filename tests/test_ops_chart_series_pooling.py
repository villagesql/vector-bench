"""Every ops chart pooled the two resource passes into one series, and the
filtered chart pooled pgvector's two iterative_scan modes on top of that.

`charts.series_key` was `(engine, build_signature(record))` and both branches
of `build_signature` are blind to `resource_pass`: the column fallback does
not list it, and the file branch reads a path relative to a per-pass tree, so
one configuration measured in both passes produces the same relative path.
Six charts group through that key, so on a `--resource-pass both` run each of
their series carried two points at every x and the line between them was one
no machine ever produced.

Measured on `PS/new/full-20261015-215006`, the seven-engine run of 2026-10-15:
the fashion-mnist filtered chart drew 24 series and every single one of them
had x = [0.01, 0.01, 0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.5].

PR #45 then made pgvector's filtered phase measure two `hnsw.iterative_scan`
modes, which the same key also pooled. `PS/percona-20261020-140151` is the
first run with both on disk, and at 10% selectivity on `tag` -- one engine,
one pass, one M, both modes, all four points on the vector index -- `off`
reads recall 0.0985 at 2,316 QPS against `relaxed_order`'s 0.9995 at 693. So a
pooled series plots as one line doubling back on itself at every x, a factor
of ten in recall apart, with nothing in the legend to attribute either
reading.

(An earlier revision of this paragraph wrote "about 0.97" for the second mode.
That was a guess of the right magnitude made before any run measured it, and
it is not what the run says.)

These tests do not read either bundle -- `results/` is gitignored and a test
that needs a 126 MB archive is not a test. They rebuild those shapes: two
passes of one configuration, and two modes of one configuration, which are the
smallest sets that reproduce each pooling.
