"""A ratchet on line citations written into Python comments and docstrings.

THE DEFECT THIS IS FOR
----------------------
A comment that points at another file by line number is wrong the moment
anything is inserted above that line, and nothing notices. Six such citations
were found wrong in two days, independently, by two different readers. Four of
them had been wrong before any of the changes that found them. **Two were
created by changes whose own subject was citation rot** -- #41 and #43 repaired
line citations in `docs/09` and `docs/10` and moved others in the same commit,
and #47, which re-derived a list of citations and recorded three more it had
checked and found unmoved, moved the one in
`tests/test_t3c_filtered.py::TestTheReportKeepsTheTwoColumnsApart` and listed it
in neither.

`docs/09-adding-percona-server.md` and `docs/10-rollout.md` USED TO cite by
line, and were each guarded: `tests/test_e1_percona_design.py` and
`tests/test_e3_rollout_doc.py` carried a `CITED_IN_REPO` table that said, for
every citation in the document, what the cited line was expected to contain,
and re-opened the file to check it. That mechanism worked. **Both documents
have since been converted to symbol citations and both tables are gone**, so
the documents no longer make the citations this file counts and
`CITED_IN_REPO` no longer exists in either guard.

The reason the mechanism could not be extended here is unchanged and is why
this file still exists: it needed a table. A comment has no table. There is
nowhere to write down what a comment's citation claims is at that line except
beside the citation itself, in prose, where nothing can read it. What HAS
changed is the standing: a line citation in a Python comment is now the last
place in this repository where the form survives at all, so the census below
is no longer a floor under a practice the documents share -- it is the whole
of it.

WHY RANGE-CHECKING IS NOT THE GUARD, MEASURED BEFORE THIS FILE WAS WRITTEN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every line citation in this tree's Python comments resolves to a line that
exists. Not one is past the end of its file. The rotten ones are wrong about
the *content* of a line that is perfectly in range -- the citation repaired in
`tests/test_t3c_filtered.py` named a line holding a `print` of the engine list
and claimed it held a `for` loop over resource passes, and the one repaired in
`tests/test_t5b_stats.py` offered two lines as the *evidence* for the sentence
around it and pointed at a memory-ceiling lookup. An out-of-range check would
have passed every one of them.

The census on `c8de6a5`, the commit this file was written against: **173 live
line citations across 125 Python files**, 136 naming a path and 37 continuing
one with a bare range. Zero out of range.

So this file does not check citations. **It counts them, and refuses an
increase.** Existing rot is grandfathered -- repairing 100-odd citations is a
separate change, and a guard that demanded it on day one would have been
deleted on day one -- while a new one fails here with the alternative named.
That is all a ratchet can do and it is the part that compounds: the census can
only come down.

WHAT COUNTS, AND WHAT DOES NOT
------------------------------
**Comments and docstrings only.** A line citation inside an ordinary string
literal is not counted, and the reason is not convenience:

* `CITED_IN_REPO` in the two document guards WAS a dict of citations, each
  with the anchor it was expected to match and a test that re-opened the line.
  Counting those would have made this file fail whenever `docs/09` or
  `docs/10` legitimately gained a guarded citation -- punishing the one
  citation form in this repository that was checked. Both tables are gone now,
  replaced by `CITED_SYMBOLS` keyed on `(path, symbol)`, so there are no
  guarded line citations left to punish; the rule is kept because the
  reasoning still applies to any table of the same shape, and because the
  third bullet below needs it.
* `tests/test_e15_methodology_roadmap_doc.py` builds a deliberately bad
  document containing the banned form, to prove its detector can see one.
  Planting a failure is how guards here are shown to work; a census that
  counted plants would tax exactly that practice.
* **And this file could not hold its own test data.** The sample table below
  spells the forms the matcher must catch. If literals counted, this file would
  have to be excluded from its own census -- and a guard that must exempt
  itself is the shape `docs/11` §0 and
  `tests/test_e15_methodology_roadmap_doc.py` both record as worse than no
  guard at all. Under the rule as written no exclusion is needed, and
  `test_this_file_makes_none_of_the_citations_it_counts` asserts there is none.

WHAT THE CENSUS CANNOT SEE, IN FULL
-----------------------------------
The first version of this file called the string-literal boundary "a leak",
singular. A review planted five forms on the live tree and all five passed,
**two of them written by this file's own commit** -- which is the defect this
series keeps finding, a guard understating its own reach. The list, so that a
green census is read for what it is:

* **A bare number continuing a path named earlier** -- a path citation, then a
  second range written as a colon and digits alone, a few words or a wrapped
  line later. `MATCHER_SAMPLES` spells the shape. Correct the day it is
  written, dead to any edit above it, and invisible to a matcher that wants a
  path in front. **This one is now counted** -- `_CONTINUATION_RE`, with the
  continuation inheriting the live or frozen status of the path it hangs off.
  It is listed here because it was a hole, and because closing it is why the
  comment blocks below are joined rather than taken a line at a time.
* **A line number written as words.** "…until #47 moved the loop down to line
  508." Not counted, and not closable by a pattern that would not also fire on
  every sentence containing the word *line* and a number. The commit that
  added this file wrote two of these and re-spelled them as revision-scoped
  citations once the review found them.
* **An extension outside the set.** `run-manifest.json:12`, `Dockerfile:40`.
  Not counted, deliberately: the set is the one the two document guards use,
  and widening it here alone would leave three parsers disagreeing about what
  a line citation is. Widening all three is a change of its own.
* **A citation inside an assertion message.** A string literal, so outside the
  boundary argued above, and it rots exactly as a comment does.
* **A citation in a file that is not Python.** `tests/make-tiny-dataset.sh`,
  `scripts/*.sh`, `webui/static/*.js`. The census is `.py` only; its name says
  so.

A ratchet is a floor on discipline, not a proof. These are the places it does
not reach, and a citation written in one of these forms is uncounted rather
than permitted -- `POLICY` says so in every failure.

HISTORICAL QUOTATIONS, AND WHY THE EXEMPTION IS A REVISION
----------------------------------------------------------
Several comments here quote dead line numbers **on purpose**, as the record of
where something used to be and what used to be there -- it is how the rot gets
diagnosed at all. `tests/test_g3_process_clients.py` does it for three numbers
measured at `ffcb3a7`; `tests/test_t5b_stats.py`,
`tests/test_estimate.py` and `tests/test_e1_percona_design.py` each do it
somewhere too. Counting those as live citations is a false positive, and it is
not hypothetical: an audit run before this file existed hit it.

**The exemption is the `rev:path:line` form** -- the spelling `git show` takes,
with a commit or tag in front of the path. `tests/test_t5b_stats.py` was
already writing citations that way and `tests/test_e7_percona_fortify_level.py`
and `tests/test_e8_package_flags_overwrite.py` were already doing it with
vendor tags. Naming that form is recognising a convention this repository had,
not inventing one.

Why it is the least fragile of the three options:

* **It is meaning-bearing, not a dodge.** A revision freezes the tree the
  number is true in, so the citation is permanently correct AND verifiable:
  `git show ffcb3a7:tests/test_config.py | sed -n 6988p` prints what the
  comment says was there. A bare line number has no tree attached and is true
  only until the next edit. The exemption therefore tracks the real property --
  "can this rot?" -- rather than a promise that it will not.
* **It is per-citation and stateless.** Nothing has to be kept in step with
  the tree. An allowlist keyed to (file, citation text) needs an entry per
  quotation and fails on a reword; keyed to (file, line) it rots on any edit
  above it, which is the precise failure this whole file exists to stop. A
  marker scoped to a comment *block* is worse again: it silently exempts
  citations added into that block later.
* **It degrades safely.** A nonsense revision prefix exempts a citation it
  should not -- but it is conspicuous, it reads as a lie to any human, and
  `git show` refutes it in one command. An allowlist entry is invisible.

NON-VACUITY
-----------
Every assertion here is over a set a parser produced, and one guard in this
series shipped green because it scanned zero files. So: the scan asserts how
many files it read and how many citations it found; the matcher is run against
a table of forms it must catch and forms it must not; a citation planted into a
synthetic tree is asserted to be counted, so the file walk and the comment
extraction are exercised end to end and not only the regex; and both ways of
breaking the scan -- a matcher that finds nothing, a walk that reads nothing --
are asserted to be reported rather than to pass quietly.

#: THE CENSUS, PER FILE, AS MEASURED ON THIS COMMIT. Derived by running the

#: may hold fewer and the test passes, which is what makes repairing a citation
#: free and adding one expensive. A file absent from this map must hold none.
#:
#: Per file rather than one total so the failure can say WHICH file gained one.
#: A total alone would report an arithmetic difference and leave the author to
#: find it, and it would also let one file shed a citation while another
#: acquired one -- a net zero that is exactly the regression this is for.
#:
#: These numbers do not go stale in the way a pinned measurement does, and
#: that distinction is the whole reason they are allowed to be hand-written in

#: measurement is falsified by the tree changing underneath it. An upper bound
#: is not: nothing makes one of these wrong except somebody adding a citation,
#: which is the event it exists to report. Renaming a file fails here with its

#: at all, so 23 over 14 would have passed -- nine free citations in a file
#: whose own guard now refuses every one in the document it checks. "A repair
