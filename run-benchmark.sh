PyYAML is required on the host but is not installed.

  Debian/Ubuntu : sudo apt-get install -y python3-yaml
  RHEL/Fedora   : sudo dnf install -y python3-pyyaml
  any           : python3 -m pip install --user pyyaml

This is the framework's only Python dependency on the host; everything else
runs inside the engine images.
